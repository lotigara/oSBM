# Performance Optimization History (since `f6809930` "switch port POC")

This document records the complete optimization effort between commit
`f68099305972503ecdffcff6703e59a9e68df98f` (2026-06-28, "switch port POC") and
`a91a0375` (2026-07-12, "theoretical stable 45 on switch, 45hz sim") — roughly
5,650 insertions across 88 files.

**Headline: real in-world gameplay went from ~4.5–7.5 FPS to a certified
46 FPS (pinned at the 45 Hz cap) in Ryujinx**, sustained for 20+ minutes of
continuous world traversal, with no gameplay changes and no perceptible visual
changes. Measurements below are from Ryujinx on the dev box unless noted;
real-Switch numbers were spot-checked early and tracked Ryujinx closely
(Ryujinx's ARM→x86 JIT tax ≈ Switch's weak native CPU).

---

## 1. Context and constraints

- **Target platform family:** Nintendo Switch homebrew (devkitA64/libnx NRO),
  sharing the `STAR_SYSTEM_FAMILY_MOBILE` code paths with Android and iOS.
  The guest GL driver on Switch is **Mesa/nouveau (nvc0)** over HOS nvservices
  via `libdrm_nouveau` — not NVIDIA's driver. This matters (see §5).
- **Testing:** almost exclusively via Ryujinx on a Linux host (real HW
  spot-checks early on). Test cycle ≈ 4 min build + ~2 min boot-to-planet, so
  the working style evolved into *batch analysis/edits → single verification
  run*, with heavy in-guest instrumentation (§7) so each run answers many
  questions.
- **Hard rules from the project owner:** no gameplay changes; visual changes
  only if imperceptible; all-platform (cross-platform) optimizations
  preferred; Linux desktop builds are unsupported (validate non-Switch via the
  Android `libmain.so` build instead).
- **Fixed-timestep loop:** `StarMobilePlatform.cpp::runGameLoop()` —
  `processEvents → N× update() (catch-up) → render() → swap → sleepPrecise`.
  At low FPS the catch-up multiplier is itself a death-spiral risk; several
  fixes below revolve around this.

## 2. Phase timeline

| Phase | Commits | FPS (in-world) | Theme |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | `f6809930` | 2–5 | POC boots; unplayable |
| Profiling + first wins | `69e5a302` (06-29) | ~3.5 → ~7 | debris fix, profiler, thread affinity |
| World-gen & startup | `bb404247` (06-30) | — (startup time) | starter-search, dungeon gen, findPlayerStart |
| Entity/render culling | `62bb0443` (07-01) | 4.5–5 → ~6.4 | entity culling, container swaps, universal re-scoping |
| Render-path rework | `74b10d33` (07-04) | 7.4 → 12–15 | quarter-res bg FB, UI record/replay, entity cache |
| Threaded pipeline | `9021cce6` (07-06) | → 15.5 | sim∥paint worker, TL json cache, HUD FB composite |
| Sim/collision batch | `345ce09b` (07-11) | (groundwork) | collision memo/batch API, always-on throttles |
| **rpmalloc breakthrough** | `98cc4361` (07-11) | **→ 31.5 (30 Hz cap)** | engine-wide allocator swap |
| 45 Hz + leak hunt | `a91a0375` (07-12) | **→ 46.3 certified** | 45 Hz pacing, fence pacing, GL pooling, mesa bufctx leak fix |

The two discontinuous jumps — rpmalloc (§4) and the mesa bufctx leak fix
(§5) — dwarf everything else. Most other changes bought 0.5–3 ms each; these
two removed *systemic* costs that taxed every subsystem at once.

## 3. Optimization catalog by subsystem

### 3.1 Startup / world generation (mostly `bb404247`)

These fixed "minutes-long hang" bugs rather than frame rate:

- **Lazy `CelestialParameters` visitable-parameter generation**
  (`StarCelestialParameters.cpp/.hpp`): the starter-world search
  (`UniverseServer::nextStarterWorld` → `findRandomWorld(200 tries)`) eagerly
  ran full terrestrial worldgen for *every planet of every system in every
  scanned chunk*. Now generated on first access (deterministic from the seed;
  disk/net stores handle both states). **Search: 8+ min (never finished) →
  ~54 s Ryujinx / 47 s real HW.**
- **Dungeon-gen collision-dirty blowup** (`StarWorldServer.cpp`,
  `StarWorldGeneration.cpp`): per-tile `dirtyCollision` during dungeon flush
  padded every 1×1 write to 5×5 → ~25× redundant touches over ~150k writes.
  Now dirtied once per part bounding box. Tile-write phase → 94 ms for 143k
  writes.
- **`ImagePartReader::forEachTile` resolved-tile cache**
  (`StarDungeonImagePart.cpp`): was re-reading pixels + tileset hashmap per
  call (~12–14 calls/part). Now resolved once in `readAsset()`.
- **Merged `Part` connector/anchor scans; merged `placePart` pre/post passes**
  (`StarDungeonGenerator.cpp`) — the latter needed care: the shared
  `preserveTiles` accumulator must only be unioned *after* `place()` or a part
  sees its own tiles as already-preserved.
- **Parallel dungeon-definition part parsing** (`DungeonDefinition` ctor):
  chunked across worker threads. Only ~7–8 % faster (cost is PNG decode under
  a contended CPU), kept as safe.
- **`DungeonDefinitions` LRU cache 20 → 64** (`DefinitionsCacheSize`): fixes
  micro-dungeon definition thrashing during `findPlayerStart` (each sector's
  brute-force micro-dungeon scan reloaded evicted definitions; verified: 89
  sectors → only 4 cold loads).
- **0-byte save-file hardening** (`StarPlayerStorage.cpp`,
  `StarUniverseServer.cpp`): crash-truncated 0-byte `.player`/`metadata`/
  `universe.dat` silently killed boot on Switch (exceptions don't unwind on
  the run thread there). Now pre-skipped/treated as absent.
- **NOT fixed — `findPlayerStart` (§8):** still 400–700 s on first landing on
  a virgin world. 99.7 % of it is genuine first-touch procedural generation
  (`generateRegion` ≈ 24 s/call: BaseTiles noise ~1–2.5 s/sector +
  brute-force MicroDungeons placement 7–12 s/sector across 50–90 virgin
  sectors). The cheap caching win was landed; the rest needs parallel sector
  generation (single-threaded, database-backed `WorldStorage` — save
  corruption risk), faster noise, or a spawn-search strategy change
  (gameplay-visible). **This is the #1 remaining startup lever.**

### 3.2 Renderer / GL submission (`69e5a302`, `74b10d33`, `a91a0375`; mostly `StarRenderer_opengl.cpp`)

Key early discovery: **the render cost is CPU (primitive building, driver
submission), not GPU fill.** Resolution scaling changed almost nothing;
~110 draws/frame taking tens of ms is not a GPU problem.

- **Debris texture-resolve cache** (first big win, 06-29):
  `renderDebrisFields` re-parsed an `AssetPath` per debris item per frame.
  Pre-resolve per frame → debris 38 ms → ~5 ms. Same-session: rect fast-path
  in `Random2dPointGenerator::generate()` (replaced per-sector polygon SAT
  tests), index-typed star PointData.
- **`drawRays` JSON hoist** (`StarEnvironmentPainter.cpp`): 3 JSON path
  queries *per sun ray per frame* → hoisted per-frame. Ray count also halved
  on Switch (cosmetic Perlin tessellation).
- **Quarter-res background framebuffer**: `switchFrameBuffer(id)` /
  `blitFrameBufferToCurrent(id)` APIs; sky/stars/orbiters/horizon/parallax
  render into a half-size "background" FB, stretch-blit under world layers.
  (Parallax shades with a 1-frame-stale lightmap — imperceptible.)
- **Background refresh cadence**: the bg FB is marked *preserve* (not cleared
  at `startFrame`) and only re-rendered every 3rd frame (4th above 75 ms
  gap); skip frames re-blit the previous contents. Sky content moves <1 px
  per frame at 45 Hz, so 15 Hz refresh is invisible. This was the largest
  constant GPU-fill cost when the host GPU power-managed to floor clocks.
- **"main" framebuffer bypass** (`setFrameBufferBypass`): with no
  post-process layers active (vanilla mobile), the world renders directly to
  screen, saving a fullscreen blit + clear + target switch per frame.
  Re-checked every frame so post-process mods restore the intermediate.
- **One-shot screen-clear skip** (`skipNextScreenClear`): when the bg blit
  covers the whole viewport, the next `startFrame` clear is skipped;
  auto-rearms so menus/title still clear.
- **`renderGlBuffer` call reduction**: vertexTransform uniform, effect-texture
  binds, and attrib enables hoisted out of the per-VB loop; per-VB texture
  binds/size uniforms skipped when unchanged (call-local caches).
- **GL buffer/VAO pooling** (07-12, cross-platform): render buffers churn
  constantly while the world scrolls (chunk/entity buffers created and
  destroyed every frame). Buffer objects and VAOs are now pooled across
  `GlRenderBuffer` lifetimes (`s_vertexBufferPool` cap 256 best-fit,
  `s_vertexArrayPool` cap 128, flushed on renderer ctor/dtor), with
  **grow-only power-of-two byte capacities** so steady-state frames perform
  *zero* GL object allocation (was ~9 unique-size allocations/frame —
  a fragmentation tax on every mobile driver). Verified via `[perf-gl]`:
  `vbRealloc=0/f`, `texNew=0 texDel=0`.
- **Streaming texture uploads** (`uploadTextureImage(..., sameStorage)`):
  the per-frame lightmap upload was *respecifying* storage (`glTexImage2D`)
  every frame; same-size/format updates now use `glTexSubImage2D`.
- **Fence frame pacing** (`finishFrame`, mobile family): a
  `glFenceSync`/`glClientWaitSync` ring caps in-flight frames at 2. Needed
  because `SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(0)` (see §3.6) removed present
  backpressure; without it, GPU-side queue growth turned every implicit sync
  into a wait on ever-older work. Can be disabled for bisection via
  `nofence.flag` (§7).
- **HUD framebuffer composite + two latent FB bugs** (07-06): interface
  renders into an FB composited once (iface 11.5 → 4.8 ms). Fixed en route:
  premultiplied FBs must allocate `GL_RGBA` (were `GL_RGB` → opaque-black
  composite), and `GlFrameBuffer` never set `texture->textureSize` → quads
  sampled a single corner texel.
- **UI primitive record/replay** (`begin/end/playPrimitiveRecording`,
  scissor-segmented): panes/HUD bars replay recorded primitives on most
  frames under load instead of fresh widget renders. Related lesson: a
  scissor change flushes the whole pending batch — an *empty* cursor
  ItemSlotWidget cost 2.9 ms/frame that way.
- **Rejected:** GPU shader offload for stars/debris (per-vertex time-varying
  animation doesn't fit the shared packed vertex format; ~5 % win for a risky
  rewrite); resolution scaling ("main" `sizeMul` — CPU-bound, reverted, but
  the FB `sizeMul` infra + a `blitGlFrameBuffer` bug fix remain); renderer-
  level persistent texture-bind cache (11 bind sites, id-reuse invalidation
  risk, ~1 ms).

### 3.3 Entity / world-client (client side)

- **Entity render culling** (`StarWorldClient.cpp::render`, 07-01): both
  full-entity-map passes (light sources + `entity->render()`) previously
  processed *every loaded entity*; now spatial-indexed `forEachEntity` over
  the visible tile range (+32 tiles for lights), with explicit sort-by-id to
  preserve draw order. worldClient 75–85 → 37–45 ms at 88 entities.
- **Entity query pad tightened** (universal): entity visibility query uses a
  6-tile pad instead of the ~16–20-tile tile-chunk pad it inherited.
- **Zero-copy entity render cache**: `WorldRenderData::entityDrawables` is
  `List<shared_ptr<EntityDrawables const>>`; under load, unchanged entities
  re-share their cached entry (refcount bump). **Critical lesson:** the first
  version deep-copied per hit — the `AssetPath` string copies cost ~9 ms/frame
  and cancelled the entire win.
- **Non-mutating draw path**: `drawDrawable(Drawable const&)` composes the
  camera transform at primitive-emit time (no per-drawable copy/mutate);
  entity layers skip per-drawable bound-box checks (pre-culled).
- **NetworkedAnimator appearance cache** (`StarNetworkedAnimator.cpp`):
  pre-transform resolved part drawables cached by an XXHash64 of all
  appearance inputs (bounded, FIFO evict). Helps static animators most.
- **HashMap swap for render-drawable containers**
  (`ClientRenderCallback::drawables`, `EntityDrawables::layers`): were
  `std::map` — one tree-node heap allocation per drawable per entity per
  frame. Draw order verified unaffected (downstream re-sorts).
  `TilePainter::zOrderBuffers` deliberately left as ordered `Map` (its
  ordering is load-bearing for z-order).
- **Adaptive peripheral-entity throttle**: NPC/monster render cache
  (skip 2/3), engaged by *self-measured* frame gap (>50 ms), not platform.
  Measured null at plant-dense spots (cost there is many cheap entities, not
  few expensive ones) but helps creature-dense areas.
- Assorted: per-frame `Assets::json()`/config lookups hoisted to statics or
  members throughout (`WorldPainter`, `WorldClient`, TeamBar, LabelWidget,
  `clientIPJoinable` 1-in-32, Curve25519 broadcast key, …); mouseover scan
  1-in-3; `MainInterface::updateItems` only when inventory visible.

### 3.4 Simulation / server / netcode

- **Threaded sim∥paint pipeline** (07-06, Switch): a persistent worker runs
  `universeClient->update` overlapped with world painting
  (`render(): snapshot → startSimTick → paint ∥ sim → join → UI`). Sync-frame
  HUD scheme: every 3rd frame joins early and renders fresh HUD; other frames
  replay recorded HUD primitives so the overlap window stays wide.
  (Star `ConditionVariable` has **no predicate wait** — use while loops.)
- **Thread core distribution** (`StarThread_unix.cpp`,
  `switchDistributeCurrentThread`): heavy gameplay threads
  (WorldServerThread, lightingMain, UniverseServer) round-robin onto
  non-primary allowed cores; main thread pinned to core 0. v1 (distribute
  *all* threads) broke boot by surfacing latent races in the libc shims —
  distribute only threads that are designed to run concurrently.
- **Thread-local `Assets::json` cache**: the assets mutex was a convoy
  (~250 µs average wait/call, ~5 s per 20k calls); TL path→Json memo keyed by
  a content epoch → ~2 µs.
- **SP netcode cadence** (single-player only, keyed on
  `localInterpolationMode`, not platform): client netstate send ×4; server
  local-client entity updates 1-in-2; client uses normal interpolation to
  cover it. Server-side broadcast halving stays Switch-gated (a server-wide
  timer would desync real remote MP clients).
- **Server entity tick spreading**: near-player entities 1-in-2/3 with
  accumulated dt; far entities 1-in-4 at plain dt (movement cost scales with
  dt — accumulation saves nothing there); `EntityMap` reindex skipped for
  skipped entities; monitored-entity set building gated to send ticks.
- **Collision batch work** (`345ce09b`): fused single-pass
  `getTileCollisionBlocks` (dirty-check + collect in one `tileEach`); query
  pad clamp 1.25 (poly sets 28 → 5–10, though per-query cost is mostly fixed
  ~330 µs overhead); alloc-free `collisionMove` substeps;
  `ActorMovementParameters` merge/apply memoization; a dead per-tick
  `collisionBody()` heap alloc removed. A collision-query memo keyed on
  region+change-epoch also landed but measured **hits=0** (movers shift
  integral regions every substep) — it is inert dead weight, flagged for
  removal.
- **restDuration=5** via `assets/opensb/default_movement.config.patch`: idle
  grounded actors use the engine's existing (data-dormant) rest mechanism and
  skip collision. Asset patches must ALSO be copied to
  `romfs/bundled_assets/opensb/` and the Ryujinx sdcard copy (§6).
- **1 Hz `.system` store** fix (vanilla bug) + BTree/file-layer hardening
  (`checkIfOpen` guards, file-I/O lock) from the save-corruption saga.

### 3.5 The allocator: rpmalloc engine-wide (`98cc4361`) — the 10× win

**Root cause of the "everything is slow" plateau:** newlib's globally-locked
dlmalloc under Ryujinx translation cost ~55 µs per contended allocation, and
the engine allocates thousands of times per tick across 3+ threads (Lua,
String, Json, Drawables, netcode). Every subsystem was malloc-bound — which
is why a dozen targeted 1–3 ms fixes kept "not adding up."

Proof point that led there: removing ~6 allocations from `collisionMove`
dropped it 343 → 7 µs.

Fix: **rpmalloc as the engine allocator for the whole mobile family**
(`STAR_USE_RPMALLOC` in `source/CMakeLists.txt`; `source/extern/rpmalloc.c`).
Switch port specifics (all in rpmalloc.c, `__SWITCH__`-gated):

- Span source = `memalign` from the newlib heap (libnx has no mmap);
  span-aligned; decommit is a no-op (spans stay cached).
- `malloc.c` libc-override **excluded** for the mobile family (would recurse
  through memalign; Android scudo / iOS libmalloc untouched — engine-only
  routing via the `Star::malloc` wrappers; Lua allocates through it too).
- `get_thread_id` uses **`tpidrro_el0`** on Switch — `tpidr_el0` is not
  maintained per-thread on HOS, so every thread got heap id 0 → cross-thread
  heap corruption → SIGABRT at asset load. (Android keeps `tpidr_el0`.)
- `rpmalloc_thread_finalize(1)` in `ThreadImpl::runThread` epilogue;
  span-map failures logged via `svcOutputDebugString`.

**Results:** server tick 53 → 4.0 ms; monster script 730 → 74 µs/call;
paint 17.5 → 3.4 ms; sim 33 → 1.6 ms; snap 18 → 0.8 ms; boot+warp 170 → 42 s;
fps pinned at the 30 Hz cap. After this, most earlier perceptibility-adjacent
cadence compromises were **reverted to vanilla/load-gated** (they only engage
below ~20 fps now); the pure wins stayed.

### 3.6 Pacing: 30 Hz → 45 Hz and the vsync traps (`98cc4361`, `a91a0375`)

- Originally 60 Hz sim with catch-up ran the game in perpetual slow motion at
  low fps. Interim: 30 Hz + 1-tick cap. Final: **45 Hz**
  (`GlobalTimestep = ServerGlobalTimestep = 1/45`, ticker 45 in
  `StarMobilePlatform.cpp`) — rate × timestep = 1.0, so gameplay speed is
  unchanged and physics granularity is *closer* to vanilla 60 than 30 was.
  The fps meter reads 46.3 at cap due to ticker smoothing.
- **Vsync half-rate wedge (real bug):** after any stall, present
  backpressure phase-locked `startFrame` into waiting ~27 ms for the
  next-next 60 Hz vsync slot and *never recovered* ("fps drops over time and
  stays down" reports). Fixes: `SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(0)` on Switch (loop
  already self-paces via `sleepPrecise`) + **tick-backlog forgiveness**
  (spare < −0.25 s → `m_updateTicker.reset()`, family-wide) so stalls neither
  starve sleep nor fast-forward the sim.
- Removing swap-interval pacing is what made **fence pacing** (§3.2)
  necessary, and on the Ryujinx side the guest vsync was set to 90 Hz so
  45 fps is a clean divisor (avoids the 60 Hz nvnflinger half-rate phase
  trap). That's host config, not repo code — see §6.

## 4. The monotonic-degradation saga (07-11 → 07-12) — mesa bufctx ref leak

The last blocker for "45 stable": fps decayed 46 → 40 → 33 → … starting
~10 min in (paint grew ~1.5 ms per 2 min), and a 2h14m soak ended in a guest
`fatalThrow` (OOM). The hunt is instructive:

1. GPU util was only 26–36 % at floor clocks while a guest thread spun at
   ~94 % CPU → not fill-bound; time was *inside* GL calls.
2. Draw calls flat, texture create/delete zero, buffer reallocs zero (after
   the pooling work) → not guest object churn.
3. A/B via `autopilot-stand.flag`: growth continued while standing still →
   frame-count-driven, not content-driven. Disabling our fence ring
   (`nofence.flag`): no change → not sync objects.
4. `[perf-mem]` (mallinfo) showed the guest newlib heap growing ~160 B/frame.
   A `--wrap=malloc` tracker (§7) with per-caller live counts named the
   allocator in one run: `nouveau_bufctx_refn` (libdrm_nouveau bufctx.c:129),
   **2 refs leaked per frame, ~69 B each**.
5. Per-bin counters in a locally patched libdrm_nouveau identified bins
   `NVC0_BIND_3D_TEX(4,2)` and `TEX(4,3)` — fragment-shader texture slots 2–3.

**Root cause (an upstream Mesa bug, latent for years):** `nvc0_blit_3d`
(`nvc0_surface.c`) marks *all* bound fragment-texture slots dirty but only
resets bufctx bins `TEX(4,0)`/`TEX(4,1)` — the two it binds itself. The next
`nve4_validate_tic` re-refs slots 2 and 3 (dirty ⇒ `BCTX_REFN`) into bins
that are **never reset**. The bin/pending lists grow without bound and every
pushbuf submission walks them → linear per-frame slowdown, eventual heap
exhaustion. Desktop apps rarely 3D-blit every frame with 4 textures bound;
our quarter-res background stretch-blit (scaled ⇒ ineligible for the 2D
engine ⇒ `blit_3d` path) triggered it 45×/s with the world shader's 4
multitexture slots bound. **This affects real Switch hardware too**, not just
Ryujinx.

**Fix:** patched `libdrm_nouveau`'s `nouveau_bufctx_refn` to dedup identical
plain refs (same bo + same flags, `packet == 0`) within a bin — semantically a
no-op (refs exist only to keep BOs on the submission list) that kills the
whole leak class. ⚠️ **This patch lives in the locally installed toolchain
library** (`$DEVKITPRO/portlibs/switch/lib/libdrm_nouveau.a`), *not in this
repo* — see §6. It should be vendored and/or upstreamed
(Mesa: add `nouveau_bufctx_reset` for all slots dirtied in
`nvc0_blit_save_textures`/restore, or reset-before-refn in validate_tic).

**Certification (run 113):** 46.2–46.3 fps pinned for 20+ min of continuous
autopilot walking at 352 MHz floor GPU clocks; paint 3.3–3.7 ms flat; blit
lap 0.18 ms flat (previously grew 1.0 → 66 ms); guest heap flat; visuals
verified by self-screenshot.

## 5. Profiling truths worth keeping (hard-won)

- **Per-GL-call and per-allocation *fixed* costs dominate on this platform
  class** (translated/emulated driver, weak ARM cores). Call counts and
  allocation counts are the metrics; bytes and fill rarely are.
- Distributed 1–3 ms fixes stopped compounding until the *systemic* taxes
  (allocator lock, driver list-walk) were removed. If everything is uniformly
  slow, suspect a shared tax, not a hundred small ones.
- Exact-size `GL_STREAM_DRAW` respecification and GL object create/delete
  churn slowly fragment mobile driver heaps: pool objects, bucket sizes.
- Scissor changes flush the immediate batch; empty widgets can cost ms.
- Load-gated throttles (>50 ms) are a **trap** at target fps: they disengage
  exactly when you reach the goal, re-adding their cost. Use always-on
  cadences where imperceptible, or self-measured gates with hysteresis.
- Run-to-run fps variance is dominated by world population and host load;
  A/B via internal lap timers on like-for-like scenes, never via single-run
  fps deltas. Record host `loadavg` with every measurement.
- Ryujinx-specific: guest `glReadPixels` readback has a pitch bug (only the
  left quarter of each row is valid — still judgeable); host NVIDIA driver
  parks GPU clocks (~350 MHz) for Ryujinx's modest util and PowerMizer via
  Xwayland does nothing on Wayland; first launch after host boot sometimes
  hangs black (kill and relaunch).

## 6. State that lives OUTSIDE this repository (reproducibility hazards)

1. **Patched `libdrm_nouveau.a`** in the devkitPro root
   (`~/dkproot/opt/devkitpro/portlibs/switch/lib/`): bufctx ref dedup (§4) +
   `star_bufctx_live[512]`/`star_bufctx_report` diagnostic counters. A fresh
   toolchain install **reintroduces the FPS decay**. The patched source was a
   clone of devkitPro/libdrm_nouveau in the session scratchpad; the original
   `.a` was backed up alongside it. TODO: vendor the patch into the repo
   (e.g. `toolchains/patches/`) and upstream to Mesa/devkitPro.
   Note: ninja does not track system `.a` files — after swapping the lib,
   delete `dist/starbound.elf` to force a relink.
2. **Ryujinx host config** (`~/.config/Ryujinx/Config.json`):
   `enable_custom_vsync_interval=true`, `custom_vsync_interval=90` (45 fps
   clean divisor; the 60 Hz default re-enables the half-rate phase trap).
3. **Asset patches** under `assets/opensb/` must be mirrored to
   `romfs/bundled_assets/opensb/` in the build dir and to the Ryujinx sdcard
   (`~/.config/Ryujinx/sdcard/switch/oSBM/bundled_assets/opensb/`).
4. Test save/world state on the Ryujinx virtual sdcard (worlds are a one-time
   ~50 min generation tax per seed; reuse them — only `universe.lock` ever
   needs deleting).

## 7. Diagnostics & test infrastructure (in-tree, mostly `#ifdef STAR_SYSTEM_SWITCH`)

Deliberately log-heavy so Ryujinx runs can be sparse. All are candidates for
stripping in release builds; an inventory of what is safe to remove is in the
session notes ("cleanup-inventory").

- **`[perf]` family** (one line per ~150 frames each): `[perf]`
  frame/snap/paint/join/iface/sim/other; `[perf-loop]` events/update/start/
  render/finish/swap/sleep; `[perf-gl]` draws/texBinds/vbReuse/vbRealloc/
  texNew/texDel; `[perf-env]` env sub-phases (stars/debris/orbiters/sky/
  parallax/flush/blit); `[perf-wp]`, `[perf-wc]`, `[perf-wcr]`, `[perf-uc]`,
  `[perf-mi]`, `[perf-pm]`, `[perf-pu]`, `[perf-pt]`, `[perf-ws*]`,
  `[perf-mon]`, `[perf-mm]`, `[perf-mt]`, `[perf-am]`, `[perf-qc]`,
  `[perf-assets]`, `[perf-dg]` (world-gen phases), `[perf-mem]` (newlib
  mallinfo watermark), `[perf-alloc]`, `[perf-bufctx]`.
- **Allocation attribution** (`StarSwitchCompat.c` + `--wrap=malloc/calloc/
  realloc/free` in `source/client/CMakeLists.txt`): every wrapped allocation
  carries a 16-byte header naming the caller; per-caller live/total counts;
  `starAllocTrackReport` prints top live callers with addresses relative to
  `__wrap_malloc`. Resolve offline:
  `nm dist/starbound.elf | grep __wrap_malloc` + offset → `addr2line -e
  dist/starbound.elf -f -C <addr>`. Blocks from unwrapped allocators
  (memalign ⇒ rpmalloc spans) pass through via a magic check. This found the
  mesa leak in a single run; it is general-purpose.
- **Autopilot** (`StarClientApplication.cpp`): `autopilot.flag` on the sdcard
  → auto-load single-player, auto-beam to the orbited world (re-armable,
  survives death), then **autopilot-walk** — continuous `moveRight()` + hop
  every ~3 s, generating real exploration load (sector gen, chunk/lighting
  churn, combat). Runtime levers: `autopilot-stand.flag` halts walking
  mid-run (polled every 512 ticks); `nofence.flag` disables the pacing-fence
  ring (read once at startup).
- **Self-screenshot**: `printf 1 > <sdcard>/switch/oSBM/screenshot.ctl`
  (polled every 60 frames) → `screenshot*.png` next to it. With the main-FB
  bypass active, `screenshot_main.png` is black *by design* — use
  `screenshot.png`. Only the left ~quarter of each row is valid under
  Ryujinx (readback pitch bug). Host-side `spectacle -b -f -n -o` also works;
  xdotool/import do not (Wayland).
- **Crash-era wraps** (`StarSwitchPlatform.cpp` + client CMakeLists):
  `--wrap=fatalThrow/diagAbortWithResult/exit/_exit/appletExit`, guest
  exception fp-walk, FDTRACE fd-lifecycle logging. Note the wrap link options
  must stay **outside** the `STAR_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS` conditional.
- Launch pattern for unattended Ryujinx runs:
  `setsid bash -c "gamemoderun ryujinx '<nro>'; echo RYUJINX-EXIT=$?" > log 2>&1 < /dev/null & disown`.

## 8. Next steps (in rough priority order)

1. **Vendor + upstream the libdrm_nouveau bufctx fix** (§6.1). Until then any
   toolchain refresh silently reintroduces the decay. The proper Mesa fix is
   in `nvc0_surface.c`/`nvc0_tex.c` (reset the TEX bins for every slot the
   blit dirties). Also verify the compute-dispatch path (`bufctx_cp`) doesn't
   have a sibling leak.
2. **`findPlayerStart` / first-landing world generation** (§3.1): 400–700 s.
   Options: parallel sector generation (needs a real `WorldStorage`
   concurrency design — save-corruption risk), faster `blockInfo` noise,
   smarter micro-dungeon placement scan, or spawn-search biased toward warm
   sectors (needs owner sign-off — behavior change). Object/NPC cold-load
   during dungeon flush (~30–80 s/dungeon, one-time per content type) could
   be prefetched in parallel during the BFS phase.
3. **Real-hardware validation.** Everything since the POC has been certified
   on Ryujinx only. The bufctx leak affects HW too; the fence-pacing and
   45 Hz settings should be sanity-checked against the real nvnflinger.
4. **Diagnostics cleanup pass** for release: strip `[perf-*]` probes, the
   malloc wraps, FDTRACE, autopilot (all inventoried; keep the guest
   exception handler, rpmalloc span-fail logging, BTree close logging).
   Remove the inert collision-query memo machinery (hits=0 measured) and
   unused members (`Monster m_statusTick*`, `ClientApplication
   m_pendingInterfaceDt`/`m_interfaceUpdateCounter`).
5. **Headroom beyond 45 Hz:** the frame has ~16 ms of sleep at cap; 60 Hz
   pacing is plausibly reachable in Ryujinx on a quiet host. The known
   next costs: HUD composite full-screen pass, remaining env refresh, sim
   join on sync frames. On real HW the ceiling is unknown — measure first.
6. **Android/iOS follow-through:** the cross-platform wins (rpmalloc, GL
   pooling, buffer bucketing, bg cadence, fence pacing, tick forgiveness) are
   compiled into Android builds but never profiled there. The same
   fixed-cost-per-call logic suggests real wins; verify with an on-device
   run of the release APK.
7. **Categorical lever, unattempted:** LuaJIT (weeks of work, 5.4→5.1
   compat); NetElement serialization redesign for SP loopback. Both were
   repeatedly identified as the deepest remaining sim-side multipliers and
   deliberately deferred.

## 9. What was tried and rejected (don't re-litigate blind)

- Resolution scaling of the main render (CPU-bound, not fill-bound).
- Stars/debris GPU shader offload (vertex-format blast radius vs ~5 % win).
- Whole-tick collision-query hoisting (bigger regions → bigger sweep sets).
- Pane fresh-render staggering (replay upload cost exceeded savings).
- Distance-based entity render throttling (cost is spread across many cheap
  entities, not concentrated — proven with an extreme-setting diagnostic).
- `LocalPacketSocket` debug round-trip removal (already compiled out;
  `STAR_DEBUG` is correctly gated behind `!NDEBUG`).
- Killing the driver's texture-bind redundancy at renderer level (risk/reward).
- ResScale=2 on Ryujinx (worse at parked GPU clocks; reverted).
- Host-side GPU clock pinning (needs root; PowerMizer ineffective on Wayland).

## 10. August 2026 Switch OOM follow-up

A hardware soak reached `ancientvault_fire` after several story worlds with
blocks missing, then failed allocations and terminated while unloading the
world. The last heartbeat reported 2.1 GiB used, but allocations as small as
64 KiB failed with over 1 GiB aggregate free: the newlib heap was fragmented.

Massif traced 419 MiB of ancient-vault generation to loaded tile-sector
arrays. Every `WorldTile` kept space for four `CollisionBlock`s inline even
though nearly all tiles cache zero or one. Using the existing
`SmallList<CollisionBlock, 1>` preserves the four-block behavior while spilling
only uncommon shapes. On x86-64 this reduced `WorldTile` 320 -> 168 bytes and
`ServerTile` 352 -> 200 bytes. The same seeded 120-step vault benchmark dropped
peak RSS from 2,420,644 to 2,066,388 KiB (-14.6%) and completed normally;
fresh Ryujinx vault generation peaked at 1,793,114 KiB versus roughly 2.2 GiB
in the hardware failure.

The same investigation fixed two WIP diagnostics: ordinary C++ deletes now
leave the allocation profile, and the live-world count increments only after
successful construction. `WorldServer` destruction also catches best-effort
cleanup failures so a storage error cannot escape its implicit `noexcept` and
call `std::terminate`.

Decoded dungeon definitions were the other large retained owner: the global
64-entry cache kept each mission's full TMX arrays after construction. Instance
creation now clears that cache, including its failure path, and parses dungeon
parts sequentially so long-lived part allocations remain on the creating
thread's heap. A Switch-only rpmalloc mapping pool obtains aligned memory from
newlib in 16 MiB chunks, then address-sorts and coalesces released mappings.
This preserves one-span reclamation without handing thousands of 64 KiB holes
back to newlib. Its reserved high-water is reusable memory, not leaked live
allocations.

An unattended Ryujinx route crossed the Outpost, Erchius Mining Facility,
Floran, Hylotl and Apex missions, a freshly generated ancient vault, then a
second Outpost without `bad_alloc` or a failed span map. It reached 3.30 GiB of
newlib arena after the largest missions, then reused that arena rather than
growing or failing. A separate saved-vault replay exposed a null dereference in
the async lighting worker during world teardown. Teardown now marks the world
left before joining the worker and clears its queued-light flag; render also
starts the worker only while in a world. Replaying the same save then loaded the
vault with its blocks visible and sustained 60 FPS past the former crash point.
The test autopilot also skips in-world cinematics so the Ruin route reaches the
actual arena instead of waiting forever at “Esc to skip”; a targeted run drove
115 entities, recovered to 49–56 FPS after loading, and peaked near 1.24 GiB.
