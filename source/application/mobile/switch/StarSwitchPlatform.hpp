// These helpers are the Switch analogue of the Android/iOS file-access bridges:
// they mount the embedded romfs image, prepare a writable storage root on the
// SD card, and stage the launcher's bundled assets (fonts + language files) so
// the Dear ImGui launcher and the game behave exactly as they do on the other
// mobile targets. They are only compiled for STAR_SYSTEM_SWITCH and never alter
// the Android/iOS code paths.

// Mounts the embedded romfs (idempotent) and brings up the libnx socket stack
// so that networking (cpr/libcurl) works. Safe to call multiple times.

// Recursively copies romfs:/bundled_assets into <storageRoot>/bundled_assets,
// mirroring the bundled-asset sync the Android/iOS hosts perform from their app
// packages. Mounts romfs first if necessary.

// own text-preview field), pre-filled with initialText. Returns true with the
// decided string in outText, false if the user canceled. The game's text
// entry deliberately bypasses SDL's text-input machinery: the SDL switch port
// suppresses touch polling while SDL text input is active, which deadlocks
// against engine textboxes that keep focus until a (touch) blur.
